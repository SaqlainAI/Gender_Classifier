# Gender_Classifier
Using the height and weight attributes of a person ,we will predict the gender of the person .Here we use 3 different classifying ML algorithms (Multinomial Naive bayes, K-nearest neighbours, Decision tree) and compare the accuracy of each of the algorithm.
The dataset we use here can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/yersever/500-person-gender-height-weight-bodymassindex

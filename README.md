# Gender_Classifier
Using the height and weight attributes of a person ,we will predict the gender of the person .Here we use 3 different classifying ML algorithms (Multinomial Naive bayes, K-nearest neighbours, Decision tree) and compare the accuracy of each of the algorithm.

The dataset can be found [ here ](https://www.kaggle.com/yersever/500-person-gender-height-weight-bodymassindex).

This is a part of my journey in learning data science in 3 months as proposed by Siraj Raval.

This will be helpful for beginners who are learning machine learning .

This is a 'code'
